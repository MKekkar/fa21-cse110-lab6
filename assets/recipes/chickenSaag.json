The amount of oil is minimal, but can be reduced further if you prefer, especially if using a nonstick pan to cook it.

Although you can make this chicken saag recipe with chicken thighs, I prefer white meat which is also leaner than the alternative.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Question","@id":"https://mission-food.com/chicken-saag/#faq-question-1607355050944","position":2,"url":"https://mission-food.com/chicken-saag/#faq-question-1607355050944","name":"What's the difference between Saag and Palak?","answerCount":1,"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"\"Saag\" is more of a broad term for green leafy vegetable curries, and \"palak\" is specific to curries made with spinach.
